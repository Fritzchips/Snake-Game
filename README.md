## Summary

---

I created this project because I want to create video games in the future. This is the first step in that direction. The snake game is developed using `canvas`, the snake and apple objects are redrawn everytime the animation loop is called. The snake moves automatically with `setInterval` allowing the player to chance to interact with other aspects of the board. This was a great experience to show my growth in `JavaScript` and an introduction to objects through the `canvas`. Later down the line this will assist me in learning `C# object oriented programming`.
